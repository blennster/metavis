# Metavis - A visual debugging tool for MetaDL

## Getting started

Build and run using

```bash
cargo run
```

## Limitations

Since this currently is a WIP these are the major limitations as of now:

* Only reads example project
* Single file support only
* Multiple highlights on same line not supported
* `unwrap()` used heavily and therfore prone to crashes
* No performance optimizations
* Limited number of tests
